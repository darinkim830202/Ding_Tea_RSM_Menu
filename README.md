# My Live Server Website

This is a tiny scaffold to run locally in VS Code with the Live Server extension.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — simple client script

How to run:
1. Open this folder in VS Code: `File` → `Open Folder...` → select `website`.
2. Install the Live Server extension (if you don't have it): Search for "Live Server" in Extensions, or run the command below.

   PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   code --install-extension ritwickdey.LiveServer
   ```

3. Open `index.html` and either click "Go Live" in the status bar, or right-click `index.html` → `Open with Live Server`.

The page will open in your default browser and auto-reload when you edit and save files.
